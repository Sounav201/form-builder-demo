This is a short guide to as how to create a form element.

Step 1 : Go to ElementBank.types and add attributes for your Element. You may extend the generic Form element attributes 
like Question ,required and so on. Also add Styling for your element (Styling attributes) and give a name to your element in the 
enumType

Step 2 : Create the Element UI in the elements directory. Declare an interface to pass the Props for your element 
and extend the FormAreaItem interface. Make sure to add the necessary props in the FormAreaItem interface if necessary. 
FormAreaItem (FormAreaItem<T>) takes a default argument T which is a template for the type of attribute you want to pass in be 
it Checkbox Attributes or Rating Attributes. 
The specific attributes can be accessed inside your UI by props.attributes.<specific attribute>

Step 3 : Again add the Element into the elements array in ElementBank with the necessary attributes imported from ElementBank.types

Step 4 : Time to put the Element into test. Import the element into FormArea.tsx and based on the appropriate condition plug it in the switch statement. 
Make sure it follows the necessary convention and pass all the required props. 



Bingo!
